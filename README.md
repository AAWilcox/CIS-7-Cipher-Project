# CIS-7-Cipher-Project
CIS 7 Course Project: Vigenere Cipher Decryption. Create a C++ program that encrypts and decrypts a message from the user.
CIS-7 Cipher Project.

This program will encrypt or decrypt a message from the user using a Vigenère
 Cipher.

Getting Started

The program is case-sensitive and should be used with an all upper or lower-case message. The message and key word should all be the same; lower-case or upper-case.

Example: 
Message: 	THEBESTCODE
Keyword: 	KEYWORD

Or

Message:	thebestcode
Keyword: 	keyword


Prerequisites: 

As of now, anyone can use this code with an online compiler and does not have to install any specific software.

Running the Program

As stated in the ‘Getting Started’ portion of the README file, the program should be able to run with those requirements. The program does not process spaces or special characters. For best accuracy, do not mix lower-case and upper-case characters in the ‘Message’ or ‘Keyword.’ They both need to be executed as in the example above. The program will give the user an option to encrypt or decrypt their message depending on the users preference.
